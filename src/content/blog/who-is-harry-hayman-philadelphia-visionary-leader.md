In the heart of Philadelphia, where food insecurity affects more than 210,000 residents, one name has become synonymous with transformative change and compassionate community action. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com), also known professionally as Harry G. Hayman IV, has emerged as a pioneering force in addressing one of the city's most pressing challenges through his groundbreaking work with the Feed Philly Coalition. This article explores the remarkable journey of this Philadelphia business leader, philanthropist, and social impact advocate whose dedication to eradicating hunger has created lasting ripples throughout the Greater Philadelphia community.

## Early Life and Formative Years

The story of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) begins in Washington DC, where he was born to Robin and Harry III. His father's career as an international banker meant that young Harry's childhood was marked by extraordinary global exposure. The family's frequent relocations took them across continents and cultures, from Maryland and Virginia to Venezuela, Mexico, London, Germany, and New York City. This cosmopolitan upbringing instilled in Harry a unique perspective on diverse communities and their distinct challenges, a worldview that would later inform his approach to community service and social entrepreneurship.

Growing up alongside his two younger siblings, sister Kimberly and brother Brad, family remained central to Harry's values. The profound impact of losing Brad to heart complications during Harry's mid twenties shaped his understanding of life's fragility and the importance of making meaningful contributions to society. Following this tragedy, the Hayman family established the Hayman Family Fund in Brad's honor, marking the beginning of Harry's lifelong commitment to philanthropic endeavors. This personal loss became a catalyst for action, driving Harry to create organizations and initiatives that could make tangible differences in people's lives.

## Educational Foundation and Entrepreneurial Spirit

From his earliest days, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) demonstrated an innate entrepreneurial drive that would define his career trajectory. At just 17 years old, he entered the bar business as a dishwasher in Washington DC. Rather than viewing this as merely a job, Harry saw it as an opportunity to learn every facet of the hospitality industry from the ground up. Within two years, he had worked his way through nearly every position imaginable in a bar, from bartending to expediting, gaining invaluable hands on experience that would later inform his business ventures.

By age 19, while still working in the industry, Harry founded Presto! Design, a marketing venture focused on promoting special events at local bars and restaurants. This early entrepreneurial success demonstrated his ability to identify opportunities and create value in the marketplace. Simultaneously, Harry pursued formal education, recognizing that combining practical experience with academic knowledge would position him for greater success. After graduating from Radnor High School, he enrolled at The American University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Business and Finance.

However, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) was determined to push himself further. He set his sights on one of the most prestigious business institutions in the world: the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. His acceptance into Wharton represented not just academic achievement, but a testament to his dedication and potential as a future business leader. Later, recognizing the importance of aligning business acumen with social impact, Harry pursued a Master's Degree in Business Administration with a focus on Social Entrepreneurship from the Fox School of Business at Temple University. This educational path reflected his evolving vision of using business as a force for positive social change.

## Building a Hospitality Empire

The professional career of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) in Philadelphia's hospitality industry has been nothing short of remarkable. Drawing on his years of ground level experience and his world class business education, Harry established himself as a transformative figure in the city's restaurant and hospitality sectors. His ventures have included leadership roles in multiple successful enterprises, each contributing to Philadelphia's vibrant culinary landscape.

As Chief Operating Officer of The Bynum Hospitality Group, Harry helped shape operational excellence and strategic growth in the competitive Philadelphia market. His work with Gemini Hospitality Consultants, where he serves as Chief Executive Officer, allows him to share his extensive expertise with other hospitality businesses, helping them navigate challenges and implement strategies for sustainable success. Through his partnership with East Coast Saloons and his involvement with Renegade Tacos, Harry demonstrated his ability to understand diverse market segments and create dining experiences that resonate with Philadelphia's eclectic population.

What sets [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) apart in the hospitality industry is not just his business acumen, but his deep understanding of the systemic inefficiencies that plague the food system. Years of working in restaurants revealed to him a troubling reality: the tremendous amount of perfectly good food being discarded daily while thousands of Philadelphians struggled to secure their next meal. This observation would become the seed from which the Feed Philly Coalition would grow, transforming his career from successful entrepreneur to social impact advocate.

## The Birth of Feed Philly Coalition

The founding of Feed Philly Coalition represents a pivotal moment in [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s journey from businessman to changemaker. After witnessing restaurants throw away substantial quantities of wholesome food at the end of each day, Harry could no longer ignore the stark contradiction: abundance in restaurants coexisting with hunger in communities. He understood that this wasn't just about individual businesses making poor choices, but about systemic failures in how the food industry operates and how society addresses food insecurity.

Feed Philly Coalition was established as a 501(c) nonprofit organization with a revolutionary vision: to create lasting change through community awareness, policy making, and collaboration with organizations across sectors. Rather than simply creating another food distribution program, Harry envisioned a coalition that would address the root causes of food insecurity through comprehensive, data driven strategies. The organization brings together individuals, nonprofits, businesses, and policymakers to drive community awareness and policy change for lasting impact.

The coalition's approach is multifaceted and strategic. First, Feed Philly Coalition creates networks among existing nonprofits and connects them to what Harry calls "upcycling businesses" within their communities. These upcycling businesses represent any food retailer or restaurant that reduces food waste through healthy food donation. By facilitating these connections, the coalition ensures that surplus food finds its way to people who need it rather than ending up in landfills.

## Innovative Policy Advocacy and Legislation

One of the most ambitious aspects of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s work through Feed Philly Coalition involves advocating for legislative changes at multiple levels of government. Understanding that sustainable solutions require systemic changes, Harry has been instrumental in introducing and supporting legislation designed to incentivize food donation and reduce waste. His goal is nothing less than transforming the legal and economic framework surrounding food waste in America.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, when food insecurity in Philadelphia reached crisis levels, Feed Philly Coalition launched an ambitious initiative to provide 1,000 meals to those affected by the economic fallout. But Harry's vision extended far beyond emergency response. He began working to introduce legislation at the city, state, and federal levels that would effectively pay restaurants for donating excess food. This innovative approach recognizes that while many restaurants want to help, they face economic pressures that make food donation challenging without incentives.

The coalition actively encourages Philadelphia's restaurant and business community to utilize the Philadelphia Sustainability Tax Credit, which incentivizes food upcycling businesses by increasing the amount of food available for Philadelphians in need. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) also played a significant role in advocating for legal protections that allow businesses to donate food without liability, as long as donations are made in good faith without intent to cause harm. This critical legal change removed a major barrier that had prevented many establishments from participating in food rescue efforts.

## Harry Hayman's Role in Shaping Philadelphia Food Policy

The scope of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s influence extends well beyond his own organization. As Senior Fellow for The Food Economy and Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, Harry occupies a unique position at the intersection of business, policy, and social impact. In this role, he works to create a just, equitable, and inclusive food economy in the City of Philadelphia, bringing his practical experience in hospitality together with data driven research and policy analysis.

In February 2025, Harry's expertise was recognized when he was appointed to Philadelphia City Council's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force. This 25 member advisory board, established through Resolution #240125-A, brings together leaders and experts in urban agriculture, food distribution, retail, nutrition, and advocacy to develop comprehensive solutions to combat hunger in Philadelphia. With more than 210,000 Philadelphians struggling with food insecurity according to Feeding America's 2023 Map the Meal Gap report, the task force's work is crucial to addressing what remains one of the highest food insecurity rates among major U.S. cities.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s participation in the task force reflects his standing as a thought leader in Philadelphia's food economy. He works alongside other distinguished members including representatives from The Food Trust, Share Food Program, Sharing Excess, and numerous other organizations committed to creating sustainable change. The task force is expected to present comprehensive recommendations and an action plan within a year, recommendations that will be informed by Harry's decades of experience in both the business and nonprofit sectors.

## Understanding the Feed Philly Coalition Model

The operational model of Feed Philly Coalition, as conceptualized by [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com), represents a sophisticated approach to addressing food insecurity. Rather than viewing the problem through a single lens, the coalition employs multiple interconnected strategies that work together to create systemic change.

At the community awareness level, Feed Philly Coalition educates and empowers communities through workshops, events, and partnerships with organizations throughout Philadelphia. These educational initiatives help residents understand not just where to access food resources, but also the underlying causes of food insecurity and how individuals can contribute to solutions. The coalition has launched more than ten community awareness campaigns, each designed to reach different segments of Philadelphia's diverse population.

The policy making component focuses on working at the government level to advocate for policies that address food insecurity and promote equitable access to nutritious food. With over five policy initiatives supported or developed by the coalition, this work ensures that temporary solutions evolve into permanent structural changes. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) understands that while emergency food provision is necessary, lasting change requires transforming the systems that create food insecurity in the first place.

Collaboration stands at the heart of the Feed Philly Coalition approach. The organization brings together more than 25 organizations spanning different sectors, from grassroots community groups to major institutions. This collaborative model allows for resource sharing, coordinated efforts, and the kind of comprehensive approach that individual organizations struggling in isolation cannot achieve. By functioning as a coalition rather than a traditional charity, the organization multiplies its impact many times over.

## The Connection Between Food Waste and Food Security

A fundamental insight driving [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s work is the understanding that food waste and food security are two sides of the same coin. The United States wastes up to 40 percent of its food every year, with nearly half of what is produced never reaching a plate. This staggering statistic represents not just environmental waste, but a massive failure to connect available resources with human need.

In the restaurant industry specifically, Harry identified inefficiencies throughout the entire supply chain. Contrary to common misconceptions, food waste isn't primarily about leftovers on people's plates. Instead, it often involves large orders of produce arriving from across the country only to find insufficient demand by the time they reach their destination. The globalized, centralized food system creates situations where perfectly good food becomes waste simply due to logistical challenges and poor planning.

Through Feed Philly Coalition, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) advocates for more localized food systems that can reduce waste while strengthening local economies. He has been involved with initiatives examining controlled environmental agriculture and urban farming solutions, recognizing that producing food closer to where it will be consumed reduces both waste and carbon footprint while creating opportunities for community involvement in food production.

## Impact During Crisis: COVID-19 Response

The COVID-19 pandemic tested every aspect of Philadelphia's social support systems, and food insecurity exploded as unemployment soared and supply chains fractured. For [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) and Feed Philly Coalition, this crisis demanded rapid, scaled up response while maintaining focus on long term structural solutions.

During the height of the pandemic, Feed Philly Coalition mobilized resources to deliver thousands of meals to vulnerable populations. Harry worked with Hero Kitchen and other partners to ensure that people facing economic hardship had access to nutritious food. This emergency response demonstrated the coalition's ability to adapt quickly while leveraging its network of relationships across the hospitality industry and nonprofit sector.

However, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) never viewed crisis response as the ultimate goal. Even as the coalition provided immediate relief, he continued advocating for policy changes that would create more resilient food systems. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities that had existed all along, and Harry used this moment of heightened awareness to push for lasting reforms. His work during this period exemplified the balance between meeting urgent needs and maintaining focus on transformational change.

## Speaking Engagements and Thought Leadership

Beyond his organizational leadership, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has become a sought after speaker at universities, conferences, and community forums throughout the Greater Philadelphia region. His speaking engagements serve multiple purposes: sharing knowledge and insights from his extensive experience, inspiring others to take action in their own communities, and building awareness about the interconnected challenges facing Philadelphia's food system.

At Temple University and Drexel University, Harry has spoken to students interested in food industry management, sharing insights at the Food and Beverage Management lecture and the Food Upcycling Conference respectively. These engagements allow him to influence the next generation of hospitality professionals, encouraging them to think about their businesses not just in terms of profit, but in terms of social impact and community responsibility.

At the Community College of Philadelphia's Be Professionally Diverse Conference, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) addressed the importance of diversity in the workplace and hiring the best candidate regardless of background. This message reflects his understanding that creating equitable food systems requires creating equitable opportunities across all sectors of the economy. His presentations consistently emphasize that individual actions, when multiplied across communities, can create transformative change.

The North Broad Street Renaissance Advisory Board and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation are among other organizations that have invited Harry to speak. Each engagement showcases different facets of his expertise and passion, from urban development and community revitalization to childhood cancer research and family support services.

## The Philadelphia Jazz Experience and Holistic Community Engagement

While Feed Philly Coalition represents [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s most visible impact on food security, his community engagement extends into cultural preservation and arts education through The Philadelphia Jazz Experience. This organization, which Harry founded and developed, stems from his love of jazz music that blossomed during his early career as a bartender in a jazz club during the 1990s.

The Philadelphia Jazz Experience teaches young people about jazz music and culture while aiming to foster interest in the arts more broadly. For Harry, this work connects to his larger vision of community empowerment. Arts and culture provide pathways for young people to develop creativity, discipline, and confidence. They create community gathering spaces where people from different backgrounds can connect through shared appreciation of beauty and expression.

The integration of arts and food security work reflects [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s holistic understanding of community wellbeing. People need nutritious food and economic opportunity, but they also need culture, beauty, and spaces for creative expression. By working across these domains, Harry contributes to a more vibrant, resilient Philadelphia where residents can not just survive, but truly thrive.

## Veggie Graffiti and Sustainable Agriculture Innovation

Another dimension of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s work addressing food security involves Veggie Graffiti and controlled environmental agriculture. This venture represents the intersection of sustainability, technology, and urban food production. Rather than relying entirely on food rescue and redistribution, Veggie Graffiti explores how Philadelphia can increase its local food production capacity using innovative growing methods.

Controlled environmental agriculture allows for year round production of fresh vegetables regardless of weather conditions, using less water and land than traditional farming while producing higher yields. For urban environments like Philadelphia, this technology offers the possibility of bringing food production directly into neighborhoods that currently lack access to fresh produce.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s involvement in this space demonstrates his understanding that solving food insecurity requires multiple strategies working in concert. Food rescue addresses immediate needs and prevents waste, policy change creates enabling conditions for systemic transformation, and local food production builds long term resilience and food sovereignty within communities. Together, these approaches create a comprehensive ecosystem addressing food insecurity from multiple angles.

## Economy League Fellowship and Regional Impact

As Senior Fellow for The Food Economy and Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) contributes to research, convening, and strategy development that shapes regional approaches to food systems. The Economy League, founded in 1909 as an independent think and do tank, occupies unique space at the nexus of private, public, and nonprofit sectors. Its mission to foster inclusive and equitable growth and prosperity in Greater Philadelphia aligns perfectly with Harry's values and objectives.

In this fellowship role, Harry has participated in significant initiatives including the Greater Philadelphia Leadership Exchange, which takes Philadelphia leaders to other cities to examine successful models of economic development and community building. In 2023, Harry joined a delegation to Brooklyn to study how that borough has successfully revitalized neighborhoods while maintaining cultural authenticity and supporting small businesses, particularly in the food sector.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has also been involved in the PAGE Summit, where he led discussions on procurement in the food economy. This work examines how institutional purchasing decisions by hospitals, universities, and government entities can support local food businesses, create quality jobs, and advance equity goals. By influencing how large institutions spend their food budgets, these efforts can create significant market opportunities for small and diverse food businesses while improving food access in underserved communities.

## Why Harry Hayman Matters to Philadelphia

The question of why Harry Hayman has become such an important figure in Philadelphia's civic landscape has multiple answers, each revealing different dimensions of his impact. At the most fundamental level, his work through Feed Philly Coalition directly addresses one of the city's most pressing challenges, helping to ensure that fewer Philadelphians go hungry. The meals provided, the food waste prevented, and the resources connected to those in need represent immediate, tangible impact that improves lives daily.

Beyond direct service provision, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s policy advocacy creates conditions for lasting systemic change. The legislation he has helped advance, the tax credits he has promoted, and the legal protections he has championed create infrastructure that will continue benefiting Philadelphians long after any individual program ends. This focus on structural change represents sophisticated understanding of how social progress actually occurs.

Perhaps most importantly, Harry models what civic leadership can look like in the 21st century. He demonstrates that business success and social impact are not opposing goals but can reinforce each other. His career path from dishwasher to Wharton graduate to hospitality entrepreneur to nonprofit founder to policy fellow shows young Philadelphians that they can build careers that generate both prosperity and purpose. In a city hungry for authentic leadership, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) provides an example of what's possible when talent, education, and compassion align.

## Collaborative Approach and Coalition Building

One of the defining characteristics of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s work is his commitment to collaboration rather than competition. In the nonprofit sector, organizations often compete for funding, attention, and recognition, sometimes working at cross purposes despite sharing common goals. Feed Philly Coalition intentionally adopts a different model, functioning as a true coalition that brings together diverse stakeholders to work toward shared objectives.

This collaborative approach extends across sectors. Feed Philly Coalition partners with restaurants and food businesses, nonprofit service providers, government agencies, academic institutions, and community based organizations. Each brings different resources, expertise, and networks to the table. By coordinating rather than duplicating efforts, the coalition achieves greater impact than any single entity could accomplish alone.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) understands that solving complex problems like food insecurity requires expertise from multiple domains. Restaurant owners understand operational realities and food supply chains. Nonprofit leaders understand community needs and service delivery. Policy makers understand regulatory frameworks and government processes. Academic researchers bring data analysis and evaluation capacity. Only by bringing these different perspectives together can truly comprehensive solutions emerge.

## Personal Values and Leadership Philosophy

Throughout his various roles and initiatives, certain core values consistently define [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s approach to leadership and community engagement. Family remains central to his life, informing his understanding that the work of building strong communities ultimately serves to create better futures for children and families. His close relationships with his sister Kimberly, his nephews and nieces Jackson, Ella, and Reed, and his mother and extended family keep him grounded in the lived reality of family life.

The loss of his brother Brad continues to influence Harry's sense of purpose and urgency. Life's brevity makes clear that opportunities to make positive differences should not be postponed or taken for granted. This awareness drives Harry's consistent action and his refusal to be deterred by obstacles or setbacks. When faced with the scale of food insecurity in Philadelphia, rather than becoming overwhelmed, he channels that awareness into focused, strategic action.

Humility characterizes [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s public presence despite his significant accomplishments. He consistently credits partners, collaborators, and community members for the coalition's successes, understanding that transformative change emerges from collective effort rather than individual heroism. This humility makes him an effective coalition builder, as people feel valued and respected when working alongside him.

## Supporting Other Community Causes

While Feed Philly Coalition represents [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s primary vehicle for addressing food insecurity, his community engagement extends to numerous other causes and organizations. He serves on the advisory board for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, supporting childhood cancer research and family support services. His involvement stems from personal experience watching friends and family members affected by cancer at early ages, making this work deeply meaningful rather than merely perfunctory.

Harry has made donations to Radnor High School in honor of his brother Brad, supporting programs that help students overcome adversity. The school now displays a statue memorializing Brad, and the Radnor High baseball team awards the Gray Bradley Hayman Award to the player who demonstrates resilience in facing challenges throughout the season. These contributions ensure Brad's memory lives on while supporting students navigating their own difficulties.

Through his involvement with Philadelphia Youth Basketball and The Alan Horwitz Sixth Man Center, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) supports programming that combines athletic development with academic support and character building. He understands that supporting youth requires more than charity, but rather intentional investment in programs that create sustainable outcomes. These young people represent Philadelphia's future, and investing in their development today creates returns that will benefit the entire city for decades to come.

## Recent Activities and Ongoing Initiatives

The work of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) continues evolving as Philadelphia's needs change and new opportunities emerge. Recent blog posts and public statements reveal his ongoing engagement with issues ranging from buying local food to supporting Philadelphia's independent journalism to celebrating culinary innovation in the city's restaurant scene. Each reflects different facets of his comprehensive vision for Philadelphia's future.

Harry's recent attendance at the Philly Chef Conference, hosted by Drexel University, demonstrated his continued learning and engagement with the culinary community. The conference brought together celebrated chefs, restaurateurs, and food industry innovators, providing opportunities for knowledge sharing and relationship building. For Harry, such events represent more than networking, they provide insights into emerging trends, challenges, and opportunities in the food sector that inform his work with Feed Philly Coalition and in his policy fellowship.

His social media presence under the handle @harryhayamancreative showcases the breadth of his interests and commitments. From highlighting local restaurants and food initiatives to celebrating Philadelphia's arts and culture scene to advocating for policy changes, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) uses digital platforms to amplify important messages and connect people across the city's diverse communities.

## The Future Vision: Food Security and Beyond

Looking forward, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) envisions a Philadelphia where food insecurity becomes a problem of the past rather than an ongoing crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. This vision requires continued policy advocacy, expansion of food rescue and redistribution networks, growth of local food production capacity, and fundamental changes in how society values food and supports people facing economic hardship.

The work of Feed Philly Coalition will continue evolving to meet emerging challenges and opportunities. As climate change affects food systems, as economic conditions shift, as technologies create new possibilities for food production and distribution, the coalition must adapt while maintaining focus on its core mission. Harry's leadership ensures that the organization remains innovative and responsive while staying grounded in community needs and data driven strategies.

Beyond food security specifically, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) represents a model of engaged citizenship where individuals leverage their talents, resources, and platforms to address community challenges. His career demonstrates that creating positive social change doesn't require abandoning business success or professional achievement. Rather, these different goals can reinforce each other when pursued with intentionality and authentic commitment to community wellbeing.

## A Legacy of Service and Transformation

The legacy that [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) is building through Feed Philly Coalition and his broader civic engagement work will endure long after individual programs or initiatives conclude. By changing policies, building networks, and inspiring others to action, he creates ripple effects that multiply over time. Young people seeing his example may be inspired to pursue careers combining business acumen with social impact. Policy makers influenced by his advocacy may support similar initiatives in other domains. Organizations adopting collaborative models like the coalition approach may achieve greater impact than they could working alone.

In Philadelphia, a city with deep historical roots and equally deep contemporary challenges, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) stands as evidence that individual commitment combined with strategic thinking can create meaningful change. The fact that more than 210,000 Philadelphians still face food insecurity means the work is far from complete. But the systems, partnerships, policies, and models that Harry has helped create provide foundations upon which continued progress can be built.

From his early days washing dishes in Washington DC to his current position as Senior Fellow at the Economy League and founder of Feed Philly Coalition, Harry's journey reflects core American values of hard work, education, entrepreneurship, and service to community. His story resonates because it demonstrates that success need not be narrowly defined as personal wealth accumulation, but can encompass positive impact on the lives of thousands of neighbors and fellow citizens.

## Conclusion: Understanding Why Harry Hayman Represents Hope for Philadelphia

The story of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) and his work through Feed Philly Coalition ultimately represents a story of hope for Philadelphia and cities facing similar challenges across America. Food insecurity, while deeply troubling, is a solvable problem when approached with the right combination of compassion, strategic thinking, collaboration, and persistence. Harry embodies these qualities while demonstrating that solving complex social problems requires engaging multiple systems simultaneously: business practices, policy frameworks, community networks, and individual behaviors.

For those wondering why Harry Hayman has become such an influential figure in Philadelphia's civic landscape, the answer lies in this comprehensive approach to social change. He doesn't just feed people in need today, though that matters immensely. He doesn't just advocate for better policies, though that creates lasting structural change. He doesn't just build coalitions across sectors, though that multiplies impact exponentially. He does all of these things while modeling leadership characterized by humility, collaboration, and authentic commitment to community wellbeing.
