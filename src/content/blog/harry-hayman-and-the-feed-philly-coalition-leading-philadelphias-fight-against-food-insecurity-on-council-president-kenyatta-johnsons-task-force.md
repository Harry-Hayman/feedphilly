## Introduction: A Philadelphia Leader Tackling Hunger at Every Level

In a city where more than 210,000 residents face food insecurity, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has emerged as one of Philadelphia's most dedicated advocates for food justice and systemic change. Known also as Harry G. Hayman IV, this Philadelphia entrepreneur and humanitarian has channeled decades of hospitality expertise into a multifaceted campaign against hunger that spans nonprofit leadership, policy advocacy, and civic service. At the center of this work stands the Feed Philly Coalition, an organization [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) founded to transform how Philadelphia addresses food insecurity through collaboration, policy reform, and community empowerment.

Most recently, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) was appointed as a member of Philadelphia City Council President Kenyatta Johnson's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force, a groundbreaking 25 member advisory board established in 2024 to develop comprehensive solutions to combat hunger in America's sixth largest city. This appointment recognizes Harry Hayman's years of frontline work addressing food insecurity and positions him alongside Philadelphia's most influential leaders in food distribution, urban agriculture, nutrition, and advocacy to shape the future of food policy in the city.

When people search for information about why [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has dedicated his career to fighting food insecurity, they discover a leader whose commitment stems from firsthand witness to the paradox of abundance and want. Throughout his extensive career in Philadelphia's restaurant and hospitality industry, Harry Hayman repeatedly saw restaurants throwing away perfectly good food at the end of each day while knowing that hundreds of thousands of Philadelphians do not know where their next meal will come from. This jarring disconnect became the catalyst for action that would eventually reshape Philadelphia's approach to food waste, food rescue, and food policy.

## The Genesis of the Feed Philly Coalition

The Feed Philly Coalition represents [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s bold response to one of Philadelphia's most pressing crises. Founded as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the coalition was built on a simple but powerful premise: Philadelphia produces enough food to feed everyone, but systemic inefficiencies, lack of coordination, and inadequate policy frameworks prevent surplus food from reaching people in need. According to the Philadelphia Department of Streets, over 480 million pounds of food goes to waste in Philadelphia every year. Simultaneously, one in five Philadelphia residents experiences food insecurity, with that figure representing over 330,000 citizens unsure of their next meal.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) envisioned the Feed Philly Coalition not as another emergency food program, but as a catalyst for systemic transformation. The organization's approach stands on three interconnected pillars: creating networks among existing nonprofits and connecting them to food businesses willing to donate surplus, encouraging restaurants and retailers to embrace food upcycling through donation rather than disposal, and advocating for policy changes that incentivize sustainable food practices while feeding hungry communities.

From its inception, the Feed Philly Coalition has positioned itself as a collaborative hub that brings together diverse stakeholders around a common mission. The coalition creates networks among food rescues, soup kitchens, restaurants, and food retailers, all working to reduce food insecurity throughout Philadelphia. Rather than duplicating existing services, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) designed the organization to amplify and coordinate the work of partners across the food security ecosystem.

### Building a Coalition for Change

The power of the Feed Philly Coalition lies in its collaborative model. With over 25 organizations now working together through the coalition, more than 10 community awareness campaigns launched, and more than 5 policy initiatives supported, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has demonstrated how collective action can achieve what isolated efforts cannot. The coalition brings together nonprofits that might otherwise compete for resources and attention, creating instead a unified front for advocacy and action.

This collaborative approach reflects [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s understanding that food insecurity is too complex for any single organization to solve. It requires coordination across the food system, from production and distribution to retail and recovery. It demands engagement from businesses, nonprofits, government agencies, and community members. And it necessitates policy changes that create lasting structural solutions rather than temporary relief.

The data driven approach that characterizes the Feed Philly Coalition sets it apart from traditional food charity models. Rather than simply measuring meals served, the coalition tracks systemic indicators like the number of businesses participating in food donation programs, policy changes enacted, awareness levels in target communities, and partnership strength across the food security network. This focus on root causes and systemic change positions [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s work at the forefront of modern food security efforts.

## The Philadelphia Sustainability Tax Credit and Legislative Advocacy

One of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s most significant contributions to Philadelphia's fight against food insecurity has been his advocacy for policy changes that create economic incentives for businesses to donate rather than discard surplus food. Through the Feed Philly Coalition, Harry Hayman has championed the Philadelphia Sustainability Tax Credit, a mechanism designed to reward restaurants and food retailers for reducing waste through healthy food donation.

The concept is elegantly simple: businesses that donate excess food to those in need receive tax credits that offset the costs and logistics of donation. This transforms food donation from a purely charitable act requiring resources into a financially sustainable practice that makes business sense. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has proposed that the tax credit could take the form of a BURT tax credit worth approximately $4,000 per participating business, creating meaningful financial incentive while directing tons of nutritious food to hungry Philadelphians.

But [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s legislative vision extends far beyond Philadelphia. He has worked to introduce similar legislation at the city level, then to the state of Pennsylvania, and ultimately to the federal government. This multi tiered approach recognizes that food insecurity is both a local crisis requiring immediate action and a national challenge demanding systemic solutions. Harry Hayman's goal is nothing less than transforming the legal and economic frameworks that currently make food waste the default option.

### Addressing Liability Concerns

One major barrier that [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has worked to overcome is businesses' fear of liability if donated food causes illness. Through education and advocacy, Harry Hayman has helped spread awareness about existing legal protections for good faith food donations. Federal and state laws protect donors who give food in good faith and without intent to cause harm from liability if someone becomes ill from donated food.

This legal protection is crucial but often unknown to business owners and managers who might otherwise participate in food donation programs. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) and the Feed Philly Coalition have made educating businesses about these protections a priority, removing a significant psychological and perceived legal barrier to participation. As Harry Hayman emphasizes, "As long as you're giving food in good faith and not with the intent of doing any harm, you're not liable."

## The Pandemic Response: Hero Kitchen and Emergency Food Distribution

When the COVID 19 pandemic struck Philadelphia in 2020, existing food insecurity challenges intensified dramatically. Restaurants closed, jobs disappeared, and food pantries faced unprecedented demand at the same time that traditional volunteer bases shrank due to health concerns. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) and the Feed Philly Coalition responded with urgency and innovation.

During the pandemic, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) committed to feeding 1,000 people through emergency food distribution programs. The Feed Philly Coalition worked tirelessly to connect restaurants with surplus food to nonprofits serving vulnerable populations. Harry Hayman also developed Hero Kitchen, a program designed specifically to feed the less fortunate during the pandemic by repurposing restaurant kitchen capacity that would otherwise sit idle.

The pandemic highlighted both the fragility of Philadelphia's food systems and the resilience of community based responses. While many restaurants struggled to survive, those that could participate in food donation programs found purpose and community connection even amid crisis. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s leadership during this period demonstrated how food security infrastructure built before crisis proves invaluable when emergency strikes.

Through partnerships with organizations like Share Food Program and Philabundance, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) helped coordinate emergency food distributions that served thousands of Philadelphia families. These efforts continued the Feed Philly Coalition's model of collaboration and coordination, bringing together resources from multiple sources to maximize impact.

## Council President Kenyatta Johnson's Food and Nutrition Security Task Force

In 2024, Philadelphia City Council President Kenyatta Johnson introduced Resolution 240125-A, which City Council approved, establishing the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force as an advisory board dedicated to tackling food insecurity in Philadelphia. This historic initiative brought together 25 leaders and experts from across the food security ecosystem, representing urban agriculture, food distribution, retail, nutrition, advocacy, and policy expertise. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com), listed formally as Harry G. Hayman IV, was appointed as a member of this influential task force.

### Understanding the Crisis: The Data Behind the Task Force

The creation of the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force responded to alarming statistics about hunger in Philadelphia. According to Feeding America's 2023 Map the Meal Gap report, more than 210,000 Philadelphians, representing 13.6 percent of the city's residents, struggled with food insecurity. The crisis disproportionately affects communities of color, with 22 percent of Black households and 23 percent of Hispanic households lacking reliable access to nutritious food. Perhaps most distressing, 25 percent of Philadelphia's children experience food insecurity, leading to developmental delays and educational challenges that perpetuate cycles of poverty.

Philadelphia continues to have one of the highest food insecurity rates among major United States cities. As America's sixth largest city and historically one of its poorest, Philadelphia faces unique challenges in addressing hunger. The concentration of poverty, legacy of disinvestment in certain neighborhoods, lack of full service grocery stores in food deserts, and inadequate public transportation all contribute to making nutritious food inaccessible for too many residents.

When Council President Kenyatta Johnson convened the inaugural meeting of the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force, he emphasized the urgency of the mission. "Food insecurity is an urgent issue affecting thousands of Philadelphians every day," Johnson stated. "We launched this Task Force to bring together leaders and experts to create sustainable solutions that ensure every resident has access to nutritious food. Addressing hunger is a necessity for equity, health, and economic stability in our city."

### The Task Force Leadership and [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s Role

The Food and Nutrition Security Task Force is co chaired by two of Philadelphia's most respected food security leaders: George Matysik, Executive Director of Share Food Program, and Mark Edwards, President and CEO of The Food Trust. These co chairs bring decades of combined experience in food distribution, nutrition education, and community development.

Joining [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) on the task force are leaders from across Philadelphia's food security landscape. Members include Najja R. Orr, President and CEO of the Philadelphia Corporation for the Aging, Don Hinkle Brown, President and CEO of the Reinvestment Fund, Dr. Senbagam Virudachalam, Pediatrician and PolicyLab faculty member at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Ty Holmberg and Chris Bolden Newsome, co founders and co directors of Sankofa Community Farm, Nicole Laverty, Chief Operations Officer of MANNA, Danielle D'Alessandro, Corporate Affairs Principal of GoPuff, and Michael Banks, Executive Director of the Promise at United Way of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey.

This diverse membership ensures that the task force benefits from perspectives spanning healthcare, aging services, community development, urban agriculture, corporate food delivery, nutrition services, and philanthropic investment. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) brings his unique combination of hospitality industry expertise, nonprofit leadership through the Feed Philly Coalition, policy advocacy experience, and his role as Senior Fellow for The Food Economy and Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia.

### The Task Force Mission and Approach

The Food and Nutrition Security Task Force has been charged with developing comprehensive recommendations and an action plan to address food insecurity in Philadelphia. Over the coming months, members engage in research, hold public hearings, and collaborate on strategies that promote sustainable food access and security. The task force's approach emphasizes not just emergency food assistance, but systemic solutions that address root causes of hunger.

Co chair George Matysik articulated this comprehensive vision at the inaugural meeting: "Food insecurity disrupts every corner of society's framework: public health, education, social wellbeing, the economy, community development. So, in a city where hundreds of thousands of our neighbors are battling hunger, we have to fight for them and we have to fight to win. With the formation of this Task Force, we'll be fighting with some of the most dedicated people across the food distribution, advocacy, and agriculture sectors."

Matysik's comments capture the task force's recognition that food insecurity cannot be separated from other social and economic challenges. Hunger affects children's ability to learn, workers' productivity, families' health outcomes, and communities' economic vitality. Addressing food insecurity therefore requires coordination across multiple policy domains and collaborative action from diverse stakeholders.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s participation on the task force brings his years of hands on experience addressing these interconnected challenges. Through the Feed Philly Coalition, Harry Hayman has already demonstrated models for cross sector collaboration, policy advocacy, and community empowerment. His work bridging business interests with social good positions him to help the task force develop recommendations that are both ambitious and achievable.

## The Broader Context: Council President Kenyatta Johnson's Leadership on Food Security

Council President Kenyatta Johnson's commitment to addressing food insecurity extends well beyond the creation of the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force. Throughout his career in public service, first in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and since 2011 on Philadelphia City Council, Johnson has consistently prioritized food security as a core issue affecting his constituents and all Philadelphians.

### Johnson's District and Food Security Challenges

Representing the Second Council District, which includes parts of Center City, South Philadelphia, and Southwest Philadelphia, Council President Johnson serves neighborhoods with significant food insecurity challenges. His district includes both affluent areas and communities experiencing concentrated poverty, giving him intimate knowledge of the disparities in food access across Philadelphia.

Johnson's approach to food security recognizes that hunger is intertwined with other challenges his constituents face: poverty, inadequate housing, insufficient healthcare access, educational disparities, and economic disinvestment. As Council President, he has emphasized working across these issue areas, establishing not only the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force but also a working group focused on homelessness and other initiatives addressing the interconnected challenges facing Philadelphia residents.

### Emergency Food Distribution and Community Response

Council President Johnson's food security work has included direct community response to food crises. In August 2020, when Tropical Storm Isaias caused severe flooding in the Eastwick section of Philadelphia, Johnson immediately mobilized to provide emergency food distribution to affected residents. Working with Philabundance, Philadelphia's largest hunger relief organization, Johnson's office helped distribute approximately 500 food shares to families who lost food when flooding knocked out power to homes.

This rapid response exemplified Johnson's hands on approach to constituent service and his understanding that food security can be threatened by immediate crises requiring urgent action, not just long term structural challenges. One day after the flooding, Johnson held a previously scheduled food giveaway with Share Food Program, distributing an estimated 11,400 pounds of food and personally delivering boxes to homes in flooded neighborhoods.

"Tropical Storm Isaias caused severe flooding, power outages and damage across the Eastwick section of Philadelphia," Johnson stated at the time. "I went out to the scene that day and saw the devastation first hand. I spoke to residents about what they needed in the short term to help them. They told me they needed cleaning supplies, help with trash removal and food to replace food lost when the flooding knocked out power to many homes."

### The 2025 SNAP Crisis Response

More recently, Council President Johnson has been at the forefront of Philadelphia's response to the federal government's suspension of SNAP benefits in November 2025. Nearly half a million Philadelphians rely on SNAP benefits to pay for food, and when those benefits were not paid out on November 1st due to the continued federal shutdown, the city faced a catastrophic hunger crisis.

In response, Mayor Cherelle Parker's administration provided $2 million in funding to Philabundance and Share Food Program, an additional $2 million in grants for food security organizations, and $1 million in food assistance for families receiving Department of Human Services services. Philanthropic efforts raised an additional $6 million for a Regional Food Fund supporting food banks.

Philadelphia City Council's Committee on Public Health and Human Services held extensive hearings on the crisis, with testimony from nearly 20 witnesses painting a stark picture of how SNAP suspension created additional strain on an already overtaxed food distribution system. Council President Johnson emphasized the importance of the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force in developing comprehensive long term solutions to prevent future crises.

"We have a food security task force and so we'll be looking at their recommendations on how we come up with a comprehensive long term plan," Johnson explained after the hearing. This statement underscores how [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) and his fellow task force members' work will directly inform Philadelphia's response to food insecurity at the policy level.

## Harry Hayman's Holistic Approach to Food Security

What distinguishes [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s food security work is his holistic understanding that hunger cannot be separated from food systems, economic development, environmental sustainability, and community empowerment. Through the Feed Philly Coalition and his broader advocacy, Harry Hayman addresses multiple dimensions of food insecurity simultaneously.

### Food Upcycling and Waste Reduction

At the heart of [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s approach is the concept of food upcycling: transforming what would be waste into nutritious meals for people in need. Drawing on decades of restaurant and hospitality experience, Harry Hayman understands intimately how food systems generate waste at every stage, from production and distribution to retail and food service.

"There's a tremendous amount of waste in the food service industry," [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has explained. "Not necessarily specific to the restaurants that I'm associated with, but it's really just the process. The whole system is rife with inefficiencies." These inefficiencies represent both environmental harm and moral failure when food goes to landfills while people go hungry.

The Feed Philly Coalition's food upcycling model identifies businesses that can become "upcycling businesses" by reducing food waste through healthy food donation. This framework reframes donation not as charity requiring sacrifice but as efficient resource management that benefits business, community, and environment simultaneously. By connecting upcycling businesses to the network of food rescues and feeding programs, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has created infrastructure that makes donation the path of least resistance rather than disposal.

### Understanding Food Waste Beyond Leftovers

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has worked to educate the public and policymakers that food waste extends far beyond leftovers on plates. "I think the misconception about food rescuing is that it's the food on people's plates," Harry Hayman explains. "It's the big order of tomatoes that just came in from trucks across the country and by the time it gets there, there's no demand for it."

This insight reveals how the globalized food supply chain, with its long distance distribution and just in time delivery models, creates opportunities for waste at scale. Produce ordered from across the country may arrive when demand has shifted, when the restaurant has adjusted its menu, or when competing suppliers have provided similar products. Without systems to redirect this surplus to food banks and feeding programs, it becomes waste despite being perfectly nutritious and safe.

### Localizing Food Systems

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s food security work increasingly emphasizes the importance of localizing food systems to reduce waste and increase resilience. Through initiatives like Veggie Graffiti and partnerships with organizations exploring controlled environment agriculture, Harry Hayman champions urban farming and local food production as strategies for reducing the distance food travels from farm to table.

Localized food systems offer multiple benefits for food security. They reduce the time between harvest and consumption, minimizing spoilage. They create economic opportunities in urban communities. They build awareness and connection between consumers and food production. And they increase resilience by reducing dependence on long distance supply chains vulnerable to disruption.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s visit to Plant ARC at the University of Pennsylvania exemplifies his interest in innovative agricultural technologies that can support urban food production. Plant ARC researchers are exploring how crops can thrive with less water, how growing systems can reduce waste, and how controlled environments can deliver food year round. Harry Hayman recognized immediately how this research aligns with Philadelphia's food security needs, stating that "the work at Plant ARC is not just about science. It is about people. It is about making sure that every city, including Philadelphia, has access to affordable, nutritious food."

## The Intersection of Business, Policy, and Community

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s effectiveness as a food security advocate stems from his ability to work across the sectors that must collaborate to address hunger: business, government, and community organizations. His background in hospitality entrepreneurship gives him credibility with business leaders and understanding of operational realities. His nonprofit leadership through the Feed Philly Coalition connects him to grassroots organizations serving vulnerable populations. And his policy roles with the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia and the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force position him to translate frontline experience into systemic solutions.

### Working with Businesses

Through the Feed Philly Coalition, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has built partnerships with restaurants, grocers, and institutional food service operations across Philadelphia. These partnerships succeed because Harry Hayman approaches businesses not with demands but with solutions. He understands their operational constraints, financial pressures, and liability concerns. He offers infrastructure through the coalition's network to make donation logistically simple. And he advocates for policy incentives that make donation economically attractive.

This business friendly approach has helped [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) overcome resistance and build a growing network of participating companies. Restaurant owners and managers who might view donation as burdensome charity come to see it as responsible business practice that strengthens community relationships and enhances brand reputation while receiving policy support.

### Influencing Policy

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s policy advocacy operates at multiple scales. At the local level, he has worked with Philadelphia City Council members including Council President Kenyatta Johnson to advance legislation supporting food donation and addressing food insecurity. At the state level, he has engaged Pennsylvania legislators about extending Philadelphia's policy innovations statewide. And at the federal level, he envisions policies that would create national standards for food donation incentives.

His participation on the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force represents his most significant policy platform yet. The task force will deliver recommendations directly to Mayor Cherelle Parker, Council President Johnson, and Philadelphia City Council members, with expectation that many recommendations will become legislation or administrative policy. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s voice in these deliberations ensures that food industry perspectives, small business concerns, and practical implementation realities inform policy development.

### Empowering Communities

Beyond business and policy work, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) remains grounded in community organizing and grassroots action. The Feed Philly Coalition has launched more than 10 community awareness campaigns designed to educate Philadelphians about food insecurity, food waste, and opportunities for engagement. These campaigns transform abstract statistics about hunger into personal stories that motivate action.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) has also emphasized the importance of year round engagement rather than surge volunteering during holidays. While appreciating seasonal generosity, Harry Hayman and other food security leaders encourage sustained commitment that supports organizations consistently rather than overwhelming them during Thanksgiving and Christmas while leaving them understaffed during the rest of the year.

## The Documentary: I Am Hungry in Philadelphia

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) serves as producer of "I Am Hungry in Philadelphia," a documentary that brings the food insecurity crisis into sharp focus through personal stories and systemic analysis. Written and directed by Kaloni Davis with co writing and research by David J. Greenberg, the documentary explores the jaw dropping statistic that 312,000 Philadelphia citizens face food insecurity.

The documentary tackles the root causes of hunger in Philadelphia, examining how poverty, racism, economic inequality, and policy failures create and perpetuate food insecurity. Through interviews with food insecurity researchers like Dr. Mariana Chilton, director of Drexel University's Center for Hunger Free Communities, alongside testimonies from Philadelphians experiencing hunger firsthand, the film makes visceral the human cost of food insecurity.

"It's a massive social injustice and oppression that people are born into poverty and can't escape it," Dr. Chilton states in the documentary. "How people treat each other and hoard money, power, resources, and land leads to food insecurity." This framing challenges viewers to see hunger not as inevitable or natural but as the result of policy choices and social structures that can be changed.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) brings his commitment to using storytelling as a tool for social change to this project. The documentary is designed not just to inform but to motivate action, to transform awareness into advocacy, and to build public will for the policy changes necessary to end hunger in Philadelphia. Through screenings, community discussions, and educational use, "I Am Hungry in Philadelphia" amplifies the work of the Feed Philly Coalition and supports the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force's mission to create sustainable solutions.

## Looking Forward: The Task Force's Work and Harry Hayman's Vision

As the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force conducts its work throughout 2025, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) and his fellow members face the challenge of translating Philadelphia's food security crisis into actionable policy recommendations and implementation strategies. The task force must balance immediate needs for emergency food assistance with long term solutions addressing root causes of hunger. It must coordinate fragmented food security efforts across nonprofit, government, and private sectors. And it must do all this while navigating limited resources, competing priorities, and political complexities.

### Expected Task Force Deliverables

Within one year of its first meeting, the Food and Nutrition Security Task Force is required to prepare and distribute a report of its findings and a strategic plan to address food insecurity in Philadelphia. This report will go to Mayor Cherelle Parker, members of City Council, and interested members of the public. The recommendations are expected to cover multiple areas including:

Institutional procurement policies that direct schools, hospitals, universities, and government agencies to purchase from local food producers and suppliers, supporting Philadelphia's food economy while improving nutrition. Emergency food assistance infrastructure to ensure coordinated response when crises threaten food security. Urban agriculture development and support to increase local food production in neighborhoods facing food insecurity. Food waste reduction requirements and incentives for businesses throughout the food supply chain. Transportation and infrastructure investments to improve food access in food deserts. Nutrition education and cooking programs to help families maximize limited food budgets. Living wage policies and economic development to address the poverty underlying food insecurity.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s participation ensures that these recommendations will be informed by real world experience implementing food security programs, deep knowledge of food industry operations, understanding of what motivates business participation in social initiatives, and years of coalition building across diverse stakeholders.

### Harry Hayman's Vision for Philadelphia

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) envisions a Philadelphia where the paradox of food waste amid hunger becomes historical memory rather than daily reality. In this vision, efficient food systems channel surplus to people in need as standard practice. Local food production in urban farms and controlled environment agriculture facilities provides fresh produce to neighborhoods currently designated food deserts. Businesses receive meaningful support for participating in food donation programs. Communities understand food security as collective responsibility requiring sustained engagement.

This vision extends beyond emergency measures to address root causes. [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) recognizes that while food rescue and donation programs save lives, truly ending food insecurity requires economic transformation that ensures all Philadelphians can afford nutritious food. This means advocating for living wages, affordable housing, quality education, and economic opportunity alongside direct food assistance.

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s approach also emphasizes dignity and empowerment. Food security programs should not just feed people but should strengthen communities, build skills, create economic opportunities, and foster networks of mutual support. The Feed Philly Coalition's model of collaboration rather than charity reflects this values based approach.

## The Intersection of Food Security and Harry Hayman's Other Work

[Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s food security advocacy cannot be separated from his other community initiatives. As Senior Fellow for The Food Economy and Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, Harry Hayman works to strengthen Philadelphia's entire food economy, creating opportunities for food businesses while ensuring food access for all residents. Through The Philadelphia Jazz Experience, he builds community and preserves culture, recognizing that strong communities with deep cultural connections are more resilient in facing challenges like food insecurity.

His hospitality consulting through Gemini Hospitality Consultants allows [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) to advise restaurants and food service businesses on sustainable practices including food waste reduction and donation programs. His creative projects through Harry Hayman Creative and Another Three Hearts Experience tell stories that build awareness and inspire action on social issues including hunger.

This integrated approach reflects [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s understanding that lasting social change requires simultaneous action at multiple levels: policy reform, business practice, community organizing, cultural transformation, and individual commitment. No single intervention will end food insecurity, but coordinated efforts across these domains can create the conditions for success.
