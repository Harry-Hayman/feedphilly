Feed Philly Coalition (FPC) is on a mission to combat food insecurity in Philadelphia through bold, sustainable, and community-centered approaches. By embracing new technologies, forging meaningful partnerships, and championing systemic change, FPC works to ensure equitable access to nutritious food for everyone in the city.

### Mission and Vision

FPC is dedicated to reducing food waste, increasing local food production, and strengthening the regional food system. Through a combination of education, advocacy, and support for emerging agricultural technologies, FPC empowers individuals and communities to play an active role in building a healthier, more just food landscape.

### Strategic Goals

**Digital and Communications Expansion** FPC is focused on enhancing its digital footprint—revamping its website, expanding its social media presence, and integrating tools to streamline donor and volunteer engagement.

**High-Impact Programs** FPC will expand its community-based agriculture efforts, advocate for waste reduction policies, and launch storytelling initiatives that highlight lived experiences and real-world impact.

**Community Engagement** Listening to and learning from the community remains central. FPC will host gatherings, partner with schools and local organizations, and create citywide events to raise awareness and foster a sense of shared purpose.
