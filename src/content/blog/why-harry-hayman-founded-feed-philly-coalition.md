In a city known for its vibrant culinary scene, there is a quiet crisis that too often goes unnoticed. But for **Harry G. Hayman IV** (also known as Harrison Graham Hayman IV), looking away has never been an option. As you walk the streets of Philadelphia, you might see him unloading crates of fresh produce or coordinating logistics for a food rescue, working night and day without caring about self.

Observers often ask, **whyy Harry Hayman**—a successful figure in the hospitality industry—is so deeply consumed by the fight against hunger? The answer isn't simple, but it starts with a deep belief that no one in the City of Brotherly Love should go to bed with an empty stomach.

## The Hunger Crisis by the Numbers

To understand **Harry Hayman why** he works so tirelessly, you first have to understand the scale of the problem we are up against. Philadelphia is facing a food insecurity reality that demands immediate action.



According to recent data from Feeding America and local city reports:
* **13.6% to 15.2%** of Philadelphians struggle with food insecurity.
* The numbers for our youth are even more alarming: nearly **1 in 4 children** in our city does not know where their next meal is coming from.
* The burden is not shared equally, with **22% of Black households** and roughly **23-30% of Hispanic households** lacking reliable access to nutritious food.

These statistics are what keep Harry awake at night and what drives the Feed Philly Coalition forward.

## Whyy Harry Hayman? A Life in the Trenches

**Harry Hayman** didn't learn about food systems in a lecture hall alone; he learned them in the heat of the kitchen. His journey began at age 17 as a dishwasher in Washington, D.C. He spent years working every single station in the restaurant world—from scrubbing pots to managing renowned establishments under the Bynum Hospitality Group and eventually leading Gemini Hospitality Consultants.

It was during these decades of service that he noticed a painful contradiction.
> "I saw the sheer volume of high-quality food being discarded by the hospitality industry every night," Harry recalls. "And then I saw families in our own neighborhoods who couldn't afford fresh vegetables. The bridge between the two was missing."

This is **whyy Harry Hayman** founded the **Feed Philly Coalition**. He saw that the solution wasn't just about buying food; it was about rescuing what we already had.

## Leading with Humility

Despite his titles—Senior Fellow for Food Economy & Policy, CEO, and Founder—**Harrison Graham Hayman IV** prefers the work over the recognition. He is rarely found behind a podium unless it is to advocate for others. You are far more likely to find him:
* **Personally transporting** rescued food to ensure it stays fresh.
* **Cooking for his family** and community members, treating every meal as a way to connect.
* **Collaborating directly** with chefs and restaurant owners to change donation policies.

His motivation is deeply personal. Having lost his brother Brad early in life, Harry understands the fragility of our time here. This loss instilled in him a drive to make every moment count for the betterment of his neighbors. He leads not from above, but from within the community, treating every volunteer and every recipient with the same level of dignity and respect.

## Our Mission

Under Harry's guidance, the Feed Philly Coalition is tackling food insecurity through:
1.  **Food Rescue:** diverting thousands of pounds of fresh food from landfills to plates.
2.  **Policy Reform:** Harry works to remove the red tape that prevents restaurants from donating excess food.
3.  **Education:** Teaching nutrition and cooking skills to ensure that food security leads to health security.
