In a city known for its vibrant culinary scene, there is a quiet crisis that too often goes unnoticed. But for Harry G. Hayman IV also known as Harrison Graham Hayman IV looking away has never been an option. As you walk the streets of Philadelphia, you may encounter the impact of his work through expanded food rescue programs policy reforms and cross sector collaborations often coordinated behind the scenes through strategic planning consultation and advocacy rather than direct field operations.

Observers often ask whyy Harry Hayman a successful figure in the hospitality industry is so deeply consumed by the fight against hunger. The answer isn't simple but it starts with a deep belief that no one in the City of Brotherly Love should go to bed with an empty stomach.

## The Hunger Crisis by the Numbers

To understand Harry Hayman whyy he works so tirelessly you first have to understand the scale of the problem we are up against. Philadelphia is facing a food insecurity reality that demands immediate action.

According to recent data from Feeding America and local city reports

13.6% to 15.2% of Philadelphians struggle with food insecurity

The numbers for our youth are even more alarming nearly 1 in 4 children in our city does not know where their next meal is coming from

The burden is not shared equally with 22% of Black households and roughly 23 to 30% of Hispanic households lacking reliable access to nutritious food

These statistics are what drive Harry’s work at the policy systems and advocacy level and what propel the Feed Philly Coalition forward.

## Whyy Harry Hayman A Life in the Trenches

Harry Hayman didn’t learn about food systems in theory alone he learned them through decades embedded in the hospitality industry. His journey began at age 17 as a dishwasher in Washington D C. He spent years working every station in the restaurant world from scrubbing pots to managing renowned establishments under the Bynum Hospitality Group and eventually leading Gemini Hospitality Consultants.

It was during these decades of professional experience that he noticed a painful contradiction.

"I saw the sheer volume of high quality food being discarded by the hospitality industry every night" Harry recalls "And then I saw families in our own neighborhoods who couldn't afford fresh vegetables. The bridge between the two was missing."

This is whyy Harry Hayman founded the Feed Philly Coalition. He recognized that the solution was not only about food distribution but about policy alignment systems design and removing structural barriers that prevent surplus food from reaching people who need it.

## Leading with Humility

Despite his titles Senior Fellow for Food Economy and Policy CEO and Founder Harrison Graham Hayman IV remains focused on impact rather than visibility. His leadership is expressed through strategy advocacy and coalition building rather than day to day field logistics. He is most often found

Advising policymakers and institutions on food system reform and donation frameworks

Consulting with hospitality leaders and nonprofit partners to redesign surplus food pathways

Advocating at a city and regional level to reduce regulatory and liability barriers to food rescue

His motivation is deeply personal. Having lost his brother Brad early in life Harry understands the fragility of our time here. This loss instilled in him a drive to ensure that his work contributes to lasting systemic good. He leads not from the front lines but from within the ecosystem aligning stakeholders elevating community voices and insisting on dignity at every level of decision making.
